# Scientific Context: Early Planetesimal Evolution

`Erebus.jl` models the internal physical and geochemical evolution of icy and rocky planetesimals during the first tens of millions of years of Solar System history.

## The Physical Scenario

Planetesimals formed in the solar protoplanetary disk through the gravitational collapse of pebble swarms or streaming instabilities.
Bodies that accreted during the first 2 to 3 million years after the formation of Calcium-Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAIs) incorporated substantial quantities of short-lived radioactive isotopes, predominantly $^{26}\text{Al}$ (half-life $t_{1/2} \approx 0.717\text{ Ma}$) and $^{60}\text{Fe}$ ($t_{1/2} \approx 2.62\text{ Ma}$).

As these radionuclides decayed, they generated intense internal volumetric heating:

### 1. Ice Melting
Initial temperatures of $\approx 170\text{ K}$ rose rapidly.
Once internal temperatures reached $273\text{ K}$, primordial water ice melted, absorbing latent heat ($L^f \approx 333\text{ kJ/kg}$) and generating mobile pore water in the porous silicate matrix.

### 2. Hydrothermal Circulation
Liquid water percolated through the interconnected pore network under Darcy flow, driven by thermal buoyancy and compaction-induced fluid pressure gradients.

### 3. Clay Dehydration and Gas Generation
At elevated temperatures ($T \approx 500\text{--}900\text{ K}$), hydrous phyllosilicates, such as serpentine, underwent thermal dehydration reactions, releasing bound hydroxyl groups as free supercritical fluid.

### 4. Matrix Compaction and Pore Overpressure
Viscous, elastic, and plastic deformation of the silicate matrix reduced porosity ($\phi$).
When the compaction rate exceeded the rate of fluid escape via Darcy percolation, pore fluid pressure ($P_f$) rose to match or exceed the lithostatic solid pressure ($P_t$).

### 5. Failure and Hydrofracture
When the Terzaghi effective stress became tensile ($\sigma_{\text{eff}} \le -\sigma_{\text{tensile}}$), the silicate matrix experienced hydrofracturing, creating high-permeability pathways that vented fluids to the planetesimal surface.

### 6. Silicate Rock Melting and Magma Ocean Formation
In planetesimals that accreted early, decay heating drove temperatures past the silicate solidus ($T_{\text{sol}} \approx 1400\text{ K}$).
Rock melted into a crystal-liquid mush and transitioned into a vigorously convecting magma ocean above the rheological disaggregation threshold ($\phi_{\text{crit}} \approx 0.40$).
Sub-grid soft turbulence convection transported heat outward to the surface, buffering interior temperatures and governing core segregation.

### 7. Iron Core Formation and Metal Segregation
At temperatures exceeding the Fe-FeS eutectic ($T_{\text{eut}} \approx 1213\text{ K}$), dense metallic liquid melts and segregates inward toward the center.
In partially molten rock, metal trickles downward by porous Darcy percolation.
In magma oceans, metal droplets rain downward via Stokes settling, releasing gravitational potential energy that accelerates core formation.

## Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical Coupling

`Erebus.jl` resolves these interacting regimes through a fully coupled numerical framework:
- Thermal solver calculates conduction, radioactive decay, latent heat buffering, fluid advective heat transport, and segregation dissipation heating.
- Hydromechanical solver simultaneously solves coupled Stokes solid deformation, Darcy fluid flux, and poroelastic volume changes in a monolithic linear system.
- Marker-in-Cell advects material phases, temperature, composition, and porosity without numerical diffusion across moving boundaries.
- Melting and soft turbulence routines evaluate pressure-dependent silicate melting, apparent heat capacity latent heat buffering, suspension rheology, and regularized sub-grid convective conductivity.
- Metal segregation drift-flux solver tracks conservative downward migration of molten iron, couples percolation and Stokes droplet settling through the rheological transition, and computes gravitational dissipation heating.
